              My name is Audrey Bembenek, and I thank you for taking the time to let me introduce myself. For as long as I remember I have been a designer, whether it is was for my Barbie dolls, creating the perfect dream house, my own Lego city with everything that anyone could dream of, or for my Webkinz who live comfortably with a coffee shop and beach. After graduating high school, I spent a year working as an e-commerce personal shopper as I was not sure what it was I exactly wanted. Having a love of math as well as working with others I decided to work toward a degree in Mathematics. Shortly after that I was presented the opportunity to learn web development. Immediately, I jumped at the chance of a lifetime and have been doing it ever since. There is always something new to learn. It would be my privilege to help others reach their business goals through an effective online presence. I am passionate about helping promote truly authentic brands. If you are looking for a fresh set of eyes to help communicate your company’s message or for any questions you may have, please feel free to reach out.
